# Gene Variant Transcriptions

In this analisis I am interested into observing whether there is a difference into variant transcriptions over the replications as well as the gene class.

## The Data

The data that is going to be used in this analysis has the following variables

|Variable    | Description                                      |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
|`SUMOvar`   | Class of SUMO gene in format `SxVx`              |
|`XCopies`   | $10^x$ number of copies                          |
|`Replicate1`| Variant transcription in first replicate         |
|`Replicate2`| Variant transcription in second replicate        |
|`Replicate3`| Variant transcription in third replicate         |
|`AverageCQ` | Average variant transcription over the replicates|

## Average CQ over $10^x$ Number of Copies
